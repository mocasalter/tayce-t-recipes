## Storing Recipes
You're going to have an array of objects where each object represents a recipe

Each recipe object will have:
* An ID
* Title
* Instructions (body)
* Ingredients - An array of objects

## Page Structure

Home Page
* Search bar that filters as you type
* List of recipes
    * Text indicating if you have all, some or none of the ingredients
* Add recipe button

Recipe Detail Page
* Url hash with recipe ID
* Input for Title
* Textarea for instructions
* Ingredients checkboxes
* Delete recipe button

## Ideas
* [Paper Mario Theme](https://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_Tayce_T._recipes)
* [Tayce T. Sprites](https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/106157/)
* [Button - flatten sides on hover](https://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/djpCG)
